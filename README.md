# email_spam_classifier
This is a Machine Learning Project used to classify Spam Mails from any given mail. Here, I have used Naive Bayes Algorithm model to classify whether a mail is spam or not.
This project is completely done in Python and using libraries numpy, pandas, scickit-learn, pickle, flask, etc.
